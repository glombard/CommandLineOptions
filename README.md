CommandLineOptions
==================

This is simple generic command line options parser I wrote many years ago (2002). It's still being used in a few projects, most notably in [NUnit 2.x](http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~nunit-core/nunitv2/trunk/files/head:/src/ClientUtilities/util/).

See the original [README here](OLD-README.md).
